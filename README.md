#how am i 

I'm **Ayat Alkayed**, a *civil engineer* passionate about programming and a *master's student of artificial intelligence applications in transportation engineering*. I will be 29 years old this year. I hope this year will be the year that my dreams come true through it, I hope to graduate from the University of Jordan with a master's degree and become a great full-stack software developer.

#the developer should embrace the fundamental laws of software.

##ther is a mindset that every developer should have.

the key points that every developer must master.

1. understand the purpose of the software. Developers who cannot conceive the purpose of the software will write a complex system that doesn’t help people that much.
2. The Goals of Software Design. To design systems that can be created and maintained as easily as possible by their developers, so that they can be*and continue to be*as helpful as possible.
3. (Mis)understanding.  complex systems is developed by developers who don’t fully understand their work,one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.
4. Simplicity.Programming is the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. A mistake caused by a wrong mindset-not necessarily by a lack of programming skills. Most of the programming failures happen because of that mentality.
5. Complexity.As a developer, your first behavior should be resistance the unnecessary complexity.a good developer who control complexity, not  create it.
6. Maintenance. As a developer, thinking about future maintenance of changes is one of your main responsibilities.
7. Consistency. Consistency is a big part of simplicity. 
8. Prioritizing. To make decisions about your software When you face many possible directions there are three important factors that will help you make a better decision.
- The desirability of a change (D): How much do you want that change to happen?
- he value of a change (V): How much value does the change offer? How much does it help your users?
- The effort required to perform the change (E): How much work will you need to do to accomplish this change?

to make that decisions an  equation provided by the Code Simplicity book implies thst D=V/E, which mean that The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change.
9. Solving Problems. solving problem methodology consist of some steps.
- The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them. Write down your problem and try to explain it to someone else.
- The second step is planning. Don’t take action.Think before acting.
- The third step is dividing. Don’t try to solve one big problem. Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one. 
10. Good enough is fine.Start small, improve it, then extend.
The incremental design should be the good developer guide.
11. Predictions.Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
12. Assumptions. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
13. Stop Reinventing.Don’t reinvent the wheel.
14. Resistance. As a developer, your first reaction to changing requests should be “NO’’.
Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them.
15. Automation. Don’t spend your time on repetitive tasks.If you can automate it, automate it.
16. Code measurement. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
17. Productivity. Your main goal should be keeping your code base as small as possible.
18. Testing. Untested code is the code that doesn’t work. 
19. (Under)Estimation. Everything takes longer than you think.
20. Running Away From Rewriting. Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases.
21. Documentation and Commenting. The real purpose of comments is to explain “WHY” you did something, not “WHAT” the code is doing.
22. Picking Technologies *Tools, Libraries, etc.* Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can Because they are another common source of complexity. 
23. Self-Development. Keep learning. 
24. Don’t be a hero.Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
25. Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help. try anything and everything you can think of.When you can’t think of anything on your own, search! Find answers and try them out. Modify those answers, see if you can understand why they work, adapt them to your code.When you have tried everything, and preferably after you have a working solution, now is the best time to seek advice.
